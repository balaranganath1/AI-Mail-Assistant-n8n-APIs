# AI-Mail-Assistant-n8n-APIs
This project implements an n8n-based automation pipeline that triggers on new Gmail messages, extracts and analyzes content using an OpenAI agent (with memory), generates tailored resources and suggested responses, and dispatches a formatted email reply — consistently addressed as “dear boss” — without human intervention.
